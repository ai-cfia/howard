# .inspection.alpha.canada.ca

## Executive summary

As part of the deployments we carry out within the AI Lab, we needed a DNS
that would allow us to deploy our services. Since we are not in production, we
needed a DNS name that is suitable for an alpha/staging environment that
complies with the following guidelines:

- [Alpha canada.ca](https://alpha.canada.ca/en/instructions.html)
- [Government of Canada Digital Standards](

## Glossary

**The Domain Name System (DNS)** is a hierarchical and distributed naming
system for computers, services, and other resources connected to the Internet
or other IP networks. It translates human-readable domain names like
www.google.com into machine-readable IP addresses like 172.217.14.238.
This allows users to access websites and other online resources by simply
typing a domain name into their web browser.
