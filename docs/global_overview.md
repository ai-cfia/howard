# Global overview

## Executive summary

These diagrams illustrate the objective for our infrastructure within the
ai-lab of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
The architecture is designed to ensure high availability (HA) across two
geographic regions in Canadaâ€”Central and Eastern while also maintaining
a one-to-one redundancy of all services.

## Glossary

**Kubernetes:** Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate
deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers
that make up an application into logical units for easy management and
discovery. Kubernetes provides tools for orchestrating distributed
systems at scale.

**Pod:** In the context of Kubernetes, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit
that can be created and managed. It represents a single instance of a running
process in your cluster and can contain one or more containers that share
storage, network, and a specification on how to run the containers. Pods are
ephemeral by nature and can be replaced by Kubernetes in case of node
failure or other events.

**Ingress:** Ingress refers to the act of entering or the ability to enter.
n the context of networking and computing, it typically denotes incoming traffic
to a network or service from an external source.

**Load balancer**: A load balancer is a system that distributes network or
application traffic across a number of servers to ensure no single server
becomes overwhelmed, improving the reliability and performance of applications.
It helps to prevent server overload, manage failover, and increase
the availability of a website or service by automatically routing client
requests to the most suitable server.

**High availability (HA):** High availability (HA) refers to systems that are
designed to be operational and accessible without significant downtime.
This is achieved through redundancy and failover mechanisms, ensuring that if
one component fails, another can take over seamlessly to maintain service
continuity. The goal of HA is to minimize the chances of service interruption
due to hardware failures, maintenance, or unexpected outages.

**Azure:**: Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for
building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through
Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides a range of cloud services,
including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. Users
can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications,
or run existing applications in the public cloud.

In Canada, Azure has two regions: **Canada Central (CA)**
and **Canada East (CE)**. Canada Central is located in Toronto and is designed
to offer low latency to financial services and other businesses in the area.
Canada East, located in Quebec City, provides French language service support
and disaster recovery for businesses that require data residency within
the province of Quebec.

**Virtual network (VNet)**: A virtual network in the cloud is a simulated
network environment that provides a logical separation of resources within a
cloud computing platform. It enables users to define their own network topology,
manage IP addresses, configure firewalls, and set up subnets and route tables,
all within a secure and isolated space that mimics the functionality of a
traditional network.
